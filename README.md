# TbspRpg_Monolith

This is a game engine for text based online single player role playing games (TBSPRPG).
The frontend UI is written in Angular (https://angular.io/).
This is the monolithic API project, there was a microservice version, but the initial version will use this monolithic version.
I have it designed in a way that I can put the 'business' logic in its own console app and parallelize that way.
